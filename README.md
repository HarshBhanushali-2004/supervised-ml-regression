## 🏠 House Price Prediction Projects

As part of the course, I implemented linear regression models for predicting house prices, both with a single feature and with multiple features.

### 🔹 Single-Parameter Linear Regression

- **Notebook:** [`House Price 1 parameter.ipynb`](./House%20Price%201%20parameter.ipynb)
- **Objective:** Predict house price based on a single feature (e.g. size in square feet).
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib

---

### 🔹 Multi-Feature Linear Regression

- **Notebook:** [`House Price multi features.ipynb`](./House%20Price%20multi%20features.ipynb)
- **Objective:** Predict house price based on multiple features (e.g. size, number of bedrooms, number of floors, age, etc.).
- **Algorithm:** Multivariate Linear Regression
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
